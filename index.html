        This is the paragraph that explains what this website is about. Because this website doesn't represent a body in need of the advertisement (company, 
        organization, event, etc.), this paragraph only serves to to fill space and provide more visual stimulus. This is the only purpose it serves. It does not 
        give any insight into the content of the website or what it represents. And why should it? It is not required to do so. There exists no objective of this 
        assignment to create a paragraph detailing the content of your website or what it represents. It should be noted that there is no real aggression in this 
        writing. What has been said is merely to take up space, of which I feel it has succeeded. This only gives further credance to the fact this paragraph is 
        useless and should not be read by anybody. Seriously, why are you still reading this? Have I not made it clear how pointless this endeavor is? Why did you 
        read that sentence still? You should revaluate how you spend your time. For your own good I'm going to demand you stop reading now. Stop reading. I said 
        stop! reading. Stop. Stop it. I said stop! Persistent aren't we. So be it, I suppose I will just have to stop you by giving you nothing else to read. You 
        could have just quit earlier and I saved us both the time. Oh well, here I go. I will stop writing now. You're still here!? Ok fine, I'm stopping now. Now. Ok, 
        last time; now! Now! Stopping now. I mean it this time. Now! Fine... you win. Do you feel good about yourself? Wasting both of our time.
